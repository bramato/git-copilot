## Recommendations

### High Priority Fixes
1. **code-review-expert.js:248** - Use of eval() is dangerous and should be avoided
1. **documentation-expert.js:213** - Possible hardcoded secret detected. Use environment variables instead.
1. **analyze-branch.js:54** - Possible hardcoded secret detected. Use environment variables instead.
1. **documentation.js:75** - Possible hardcoded secret detected. Use environment variables instead.
1. **review.js:76** - Possible hardcoded secret detected. Use environment variables instead.

### Code Quality Improvements
- Remove debug statements (console.log) before production
- Replace magic numbers with named constants
- Break down complex functions into smaller, focused units
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Consider async alternatives for synchronous operations

### Best Practices
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Include unit tests for critical functions
- Document complex algorithms with comments
- Use consistent code formatting
- Follow established naming conventions
